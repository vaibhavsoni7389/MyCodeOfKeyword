NOTE: Please install AnySoftKeyboard along with this one. This package contains only Nias dictionary

Nias language pack contains keyboard layouts with Nias characteristics, i.e. with characters ö (to the right of letter l) and ŵ (to the right of the letter p) as well as the frequently used apostroph key (to the right of ö) .

In addition there is now a special keyboard layout for Wiki writing/editing for people who write a lot on Nias Wikipedia/Wiktionary (the most used codes are available on the top row).

The spelling dictionary has over 10,000 words. It was built on word-list created from an <i>unpublished</i> translation of the New Testament by Fr. Hadrian Hess and Yulius Lahagu.

For improving the word frequency rate, additional words scrapped from Sura Ni'amoni'ö by jw.org (https://www.jw.org/nia/publikasi/sura-niamonio/) were used.
